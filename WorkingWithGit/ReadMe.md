Your repository link will look like https://github.com/spl-sem/<YourName> and will already have the necessary folder structure in it.

You should follow the following steps to work with your repository (all commands should be executed on the terminal):

* Go to the folder where you want to keep the local copy of your repository
* Run `git clone <repoLink>`. This will create a folder called <YourName> which will contain your repository.
* Run `cd <YourName>` then `ls`, you should see the different folders there.

Suppose you want to submit the paper review for Oct.16:

* Create your review file "Myreview.doc" (or "Myreview.<whateverextension") in the Oct.16 folder
* Run `git add Myreview.doc`
* Run `git commit Myreview.doc`
* Run `git push`
